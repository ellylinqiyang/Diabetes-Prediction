The dataset consits of 17 files: 2 common files and 15 data files that are in comman separated value (csv) format. Please refer to the data dictionary for relational data schema.

## Executive Summary
Over 25 million people, or nearly 8.3% of the entire United States population, have diabetes. Diabetes is also associated with a wide range of complications from heart disease and stroke to blindness and kidney disease. Predicting who has diabetes will lead to a better understanding of these complications and the common comorbidities that diabetics suffer.
The goal of this project is to build a model that identifies patients that have a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diagnosis of T2DM is defined by a set of ICD9 codes: {'250', '250.0', 250.\*0, and 250.\*2} where 250.\*0 means '250.00', '250.10', '250.20', ... '250.90' and 250.\*2 means '250.02', '250.12', ... '250.92'. Note that ICD9 codes 250.\*1 and 250.\*3 are for Type I diabetes mellitus and are not to be classified. ICD9 codes are found in the table SyncDiagnosis.
